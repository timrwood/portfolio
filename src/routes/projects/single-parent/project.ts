  description: [
    'In the blocks surrounding Douglass Park, over 80% of households are led by single parents. In addition to performing paid labor to financially support their families, these parents also perform around thirty hours a week of unpaid domestic labor, leaving little time for rest or play or personal development.',
    'After researching historical precendents of collective living, the project proposes collecting and redistributing domestic labor into programs distributed through the neighborhood and connected back to a monolithic housing form with raised corridors.',
    'By moving the burden of domestic labor from the individual to the collective, single parents have time to nurture themselves and their children, instead of merely surviving.'
