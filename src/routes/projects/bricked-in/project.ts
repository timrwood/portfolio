  description: [
    'A patchy wall of Chicago common brick looms over the alley, speckled with shades of burnt umber and blackened terra cotta. On the second and third floors, the monolithic surface gives way to regularly spaced punched openings. Rectangular windows are set in rectangular black frames, aligned to the rectangular brick grid. Above each window, a shallow brick arch is the only break from orthogonality, the curve of the lintel engineered to distribute the weight of the bricks above the window to its sides.',
    'On the ground floor, the regularly spaced punched openings have been un-punched. What was an opening has now been filled with new brick, different in hue and shade from its surroundings, having been cooked from another clay at another time. Even if a perfect color match had been found for the infill, the repair job would be betrayed by the arch that remains, now stripped of its role in redirecting structural forces and imbedded in a continuous flat surface. The slight deflection in the mortar lines gives anyone looking close enough a clue that a window once lived here.'
